    <h4>🎒 Q: How do you charge the end customer and know where to deliver, etc.?</h4>
  </div>

  <div class="answer">
    If customer is using text messaging, we will send you a 128-bit encrypted HTTPS link via SMS that you can click to enter your credit card number. We do not store your credit card number. All payment processing is handled by Stripe.

    If the customer is using Facebook messenger, the first time he/she would want to process a paiement through Facebook Messenger paiement feature, it will ask for his/her credit card info, address, etc. After that, we know who they are and everything's on autopilot.
